# Obsidian Knowledge Base

This vault is for documentation, research, logs, prompt templates, and AI experiment tracking for the Trading App project.

## Best Practices
- **Do NOT store live or duplicate code here.**
- Use this vault for:
  - Architecture docs
  - Trading strategies
  - Prompt engineering
  - Research notes
  - Logs and experiment tracking
  - Diagrams and planning
- Reference code in the real codebase (`apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`) using code snippets or links.

## How to Link to Code
- Use markdown code blocks for snippets:
  ```python
  # Example from apps/backend/app.py
  def my_function():
      pass
  ```
- For full files, link to the file path:
  `[See backend/app.py](../../apps/backend/app.py)`

## AI Experiment Tracking
- Use the provided `ai_experiment_template.md` for logging prompts, results, and learnings.

## Plugins
- Use plugins for diagrams, kanban, backlinks, and daily notes to enhance your workflow.
